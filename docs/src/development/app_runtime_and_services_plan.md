# App Runtime And Services Plan

## Context

This document replaces the previous `native_platforms` and App Store Connect prototype direction.

The old implementation is being deleted in this branch before release. The goal is to remove the incomplete model completely, then rebuild on a clearer architecture.

## Prototype History

The deleted prototype landed incrementally and without a stable long-term model:

- `062005c7d7` added early Apple project, scheme, simulator, and device support.
- `1b62d52b76` and `c6a3c0c7e5` expanded the App Store Connect prototype.
- `1b778b5508` and `db6032ef36` refactored build pipeline details.
- `2e7c24c7b4` and `0092913517` moved the feature into the workspace sidebar model.
- `cc6caaabc2` redesigned the sidebar panel with native GPUI components.

That work proved user interest, but it also revealed that the implementation was organized around the wrong abstractions.

## Why The Prototype Was Deleted

The deleted implementation had three core problems:

1. It treated native and mobile development as a special sidebar feature instead of normal project execution.
2. It mixed local runtime tooling and remote service management into one product area.
3. It encoded Apple-specific UI and workflow choices too early, before Sofintel had a general model for project detection, targets, devices, execution, and services.

The result was a split design:

- build and device controls lived in a dock panel
- App Store Connect already behaved like a workspace item
- the naming and crate boundaries implied a permanent product direction that is no longer desired

## Agreed Direction

Sofintel should support development for web, desktop, mobile, and cross-platform projects from one environment.

The right architectural axis is:

- project detection
- capabilities
- targets and devices
- build and run execution
- remote services and release management

This is explicitly not organized around a `native platforms` concept.

## Product Model

Sofintel should have three distinct layers:

### 1. Action Layer

This is the lightweight entry point for project execution.

It should:

- be reachable from the title bar or command palette
- open a dialog with target, device, and action controls
- stay out of the user’s way in monorepos and non-runnable workspaces

This layer is for fast actions, not for rich dashboards.

### 2. Execution Surfaces

These appear only after the user does something.

Examples:

- running opens or updates a run session item
- building opens or updates build output

The user should keep editing code normally and only see these surfaces when an action produces output.

### 3. Service Management

This is a separate product area from local runtime tooling.

Examples:

- App Store Connect
- Vercel
- Convex
- Supabase

These should be modeled as providers behind an internal service abstraction. The internal abstraction may later become a public protocol once the model has been proven across multiple providers.

Service management should also use one reusable shell across providers instead of bespoke sidebars per integration.

That shared shell should own:

- provider switching
- resource or project switching when a provider exposes resources
- provider section navigation
- workflow target selection when a provider exposes deploy or release targets
- workflow selection and invocation for shared service workflows such as deploy, release, and status
- workflow execution state for the active provider workflow
- authentication status and authentication UI in the sidebar footer

Provider adapters should own:

- provider-specific async loading and refresh behavior
- provider-specific mapping from provider data to shared workflow models
- provider-specific content rendering in the main surface
- optional footer extensions when a provider needs more than the shared auth shell

## Capability Model

Sofintel should detect what a workspace can do, then expose the relevant controls.

Capabilities can include:

- discover targets
- discover devices
- run on simulator
- run on physical device
- build artifacts
- upload release artifacts
- manage service metadata

The UI should respond to capabilities, not to hardcoded framework names.

## Tooling Model

Local runtime tooling and remote services are different layers.

Local runtime tooling includes:

- Xcode
- simulators
- physical device tooling

Remote services include:

- App Store Connect
- Vercel
- Convex
- Supabase

Xcode is not analogous to App Store Connect. The model must preserve that distinction.

## Language Model

Language support should continue to live in Sofintel’s existing language/editor/LSP architecture.

What gets added here is not a separate native-language subsystem. What gets added is orchestration on top of existing language support:

- project detection
- runtime capability detection
- target and device selection
- execution and output routing
- service provider integration

## Planned Crate Boundaries

The replacement direction should use new names and new boundaries rather than extending the deleted crates.

Proposed shape:

- `app_runtime`
- `app_runtime_ui`
- `service_hub`
- provider crates such as `apple_tooling`, `gpui_tooling`

These names are placeholders. The important decision is the separation of responsibilities.

## Steps

Status snapshot on `feature/app-runtime-next-steps` as of 2026-03-27.

### Step 1: Delete The Prototype

Status: Done in this branch.

- [x] remove `native_platforms`
- [x] remove `native_platforms_ui`
- [x] remove workspace integration and marketing references

### Step 2: Define Detection And Capability Interfaces

Status: Done in this worktree.

- [x] detect Apple runnable project types in the workspace
- [x] detect GPUI runnable project types in the workspace
- [x] map detected projects to capability sets
- [x] keep the model independent from UI concerns

### Step 3: Build The Action Dialog

Status: Done in this worktree.

- [x] add a title bar button and command palette entry
- [x] open a dialog for target selection, device selection, and execution actions

### Step 4: Add Execution Surfaces

Status: Done in this worktree.

- [x] route Apple and GPUI run/build actions into reusable center-pane execution surfaces
- [x] separate runtime action selection from execution dispatch
- [x] create dedicated non-terminal run/build output items

### Step 5: Add Apple As The First Provider Set

Status: Done in this worktree.

- [x] implement Apple runtime capabilities against the new model, including simulator and macOS desktop local destinations
- [x] reintroduce App Store Connect as a service provider, not as part of a `native platforms` feature

### Step 6: Add GPUI Support

Status: Done in this worktree.

- [x] implement GPUI project detection and execution support

### Step 7: Introduce Internal Service Provider And Workflow Abstractions

Status: Done in this worktree as of 2026-04-05.

- [x] introduce an internal `service_hub` model
- [x] add a real App Store Connect provider backed by `asc` command planning
- [x] mature the internal service model around first-class provider targets, workflows, and workflow run state
- [x] keep the shared shell responsible for provider switching, resource switching, navigation, workflow selection, workflow execution state, and shared auth chrome
- [x] keep provider panes provider-specific while layering shared workflow controls above them in the main surface
- [x] validate explicit artifact handoff for ASC build upload operations
- [x] replace the deprecated ASC `release run` path with the canonical `asc publish` workflows
- [x] surface ASC authentication, app browsing, build browsing, publish to TestFlight, publish to App Store, and release status in a workspace item
- [x] refactor the Service Hub UI around a reusable provider shell with shared provider, resource, navigation, workflow, and auth surfaces

### Step 8: Consider Protocol Extraction Later

Status: Done for this phase.

- [x] do not publish a protocol early
- [x] first prove the model inside Sofintel
- [x] keep protocol extraction explicitly deferred until a later multi-provider phase

## Non-Goals For The Rebuild

- no provider-specific sidebar-native feature area
- no Apple-first naming that constrains future architecture
- no large dashboard as the default interaction model
- no public protocol until the internal abstraction is proven
